   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to YeoLab/welcome's documentation!

Getting started (wetlab)
------------------------

Check out this google doc on our `wet lab practices`_.

Getting started (drylab)
------------------------

Set up your computer for drylab development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. First thing you'll want to do is get an account on TSCC. Email `Jim Hayes`_ and ask to be added to the groups ``yeo-group`` and ``scrm-group``.

2. If you don't have a Github_ account yet, go make one.

3. Ask to get added to the YeoLab group on Github.

4. Install hub_. If you have a Mac, install via brew_.

5. Install the `Anaconda Python Distribution`_ to your laptop.

6. Install PyCharm_ (Community edition is fine).

Next, here are the TSCC-specific setups. This is pretty big so it's a
separate page.
