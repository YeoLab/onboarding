Getting Started
===============

Sanford Internet Access
-----------------------

For access to wired internet in SCRM, submit your machine ID via this
`ethernet form`_.

Printing
--------

To get set up with printing go to the `SCRM Printing`_ website. We use the
3rd floor printer. Ask someone in the lab for the account password.

Reserving rooms in SCRM building
--------------------------------

To reserve rooms in the SCRM building, use their clunky `room reservation`_
website. You need to be physically located in the SCRM building to use it,
as it will only work for building occupants. You could also be fancy and VPN
 in.

Access to Compute Environments
------------------------------

The lab currently uses two compute clusters, which each require separate
access. To gain access, an email request must be sent to the admins. CC
`Gene Yeo`_ on the email.

TSCC
~~~~

For TSCC, new user access will be requested from  `Jim Hayes`_. You will
need to ask him to be added to the groups ``yeo-group`` and ``scrm-group``.

Oolite
~~~~~~

For Oolite, new user access will be requested from `Qian Liu`_. You will
need to ask him to be added to the group 'yeolab'.

Online Resources
----------------
There are a few internet resources utilized by the lab. You will have to make accounts on these websites:

* Github_ -- Code repository, for sharing code within the lab.
* Slack_ -- For lab communication. Chat client with integration with
  Github, etc for sharing code and FIGURES! No more emailing random figures
* Asana_-- Task manager.
* Dropbox_ -- File sharing.


Internal Resources
------------------

Google Drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a folder on Google Drive that contains information shared within
the lab. Ask anyone with access to invite you to this folder. Once invited,
please insert your own information into the 'Yeo Lab personnel' document.

Google Calendar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a Google Calendar that has Gene's and lab member's meeting
schedules and out of town dates. Ask someone with admin level privileges to
give you access.

Currently: `Olga Botvinnik`_


Mailing Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a shared mailing list that goes to every member of the lab. Ask
someone with admin level privileges to add you to this mailing list.

Currently: `Dave Nelles`_


Sauron web server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At some point you may require access to our web-server Sauron in order to
make data web-visible. Ask someone with admin level privileges to create a
user account for you.
